Description: automated theorem prover for SMT problems
 CVC4 is an efficient automatic theorem prover for satisfiability
 modulo theories (SMT) problems. It can be used to prove the validity
 (or, dually, the satisfiability) of first-order formulas in a large
 number of built-in logical theories and their combination.
 .
 CVC4 is intended to be an open and extensible SMT engine, and it can
 be used as a stand-alone tool or as a library. It is the fourth in
 the Cooperating Validity Checker family of tools (also including CVC,
 CVC Lite and CVC3). CVC4 has been designed to increase the
 performance and reduce the memory overhead of its predecessors.
 .
 This package contains binaries needed to use CVC4 as a stand-alone
 tool.
