Comment:   CVC4 is available under both the BSD-3-clause and the
           GPL-3+ licenses. For optimal performance, linking against
           GPL libraries is recommended, which is why this package is
           built and linked against those libraries, resulting in CVC4
           being covered by the GPL-3+ license.
